2. **If the app doesn't start**:
   - Make sure no other app is using port 5180
   - Try killing existing processes:
     ```bash
     # Find processes using port 5180
     lsof -i :5180
     # Kill them (replace [PID] with the process ID)
     kill [PID]
     ```

   - `Cmd/Ctrl + H`: Take screenshot
   - `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter`: Get solution
   - `Cmd/Ctrl + Arrow Keys`: Move window
   - `Cmd/Ctrl + F`: Toggle fullscreen mode (makes the app visible across the whole screen)

### Troubleshooting

If you see errors:
1. Delete the `node_modules` folder
2. Delete `package-lock.json`
3. Run `npm install` again
4. Try running the app again using Method 1
